# SoftWx.Match
##### C# library to text and person name fuzzy matching
Available as a nuget package [SoftWx.Match](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SoftWx.Match/)

This project started as a place to put code related to a series of blog posts I made on optimizing the Levenshtein and Damerau-Levenshtein algorithms:

[Optimizing Levenshtein Algorithm in C#](http://blog.softwx.net/2014/12/optimizing-levenshtein-algorithm-in-c.html)

[Optimizing Damerau-Levenshtein in C#](http://blog.softwx.net/2015/01/optimizing-damerau-levenshtein_15.html)

Beginning with version 2, I'll be fleshing out the library with additional functionality. Most of this comes out of work I've done over the past several years working on high confidence matching of person data. A primary goal of the library is to provide methods that are optimized for speed and memory efficiency. To the best of my knowledge, the Levenshtein and Damerau-Levenshtein function implementations in this libary are among the faster and more memory efficient ones available, and for non-trivial strings, possibly the fastest.

In many cases, functionality is exposed as methods in instantiable classes, and also as static class methods.

Immediate future plans are first to add similarity functions for Levenshtein and Damerau-Levenshtein. After that, I'll be adding some function specifically for person name matching, including a novel phonetic algorithm.

#### Distance
This includes classes that implement an IDistance interface by exposing methods for computing the distance between two strings.
### Levenshtein
This class provides methods that compute the Levenshtein edit distance.
```
// instantiated class version
var ed = new Levenshtein();
var dist = ed.Distance("flintstone", "hanson");
// you can also specify the max distance you care about, which can result in significant speed improvement
var dist = ed.Distance("flintstone", "hanson", 2);

// static class version
var dist = Levenshtein.Distance("flintstone", "hanson");
dist = Levenshtein.Distance("flintstone", "hanson", 2);
```
### Damerau-Levenshtein OSA
This class provides methods that compute the Damerau-Levenshtein optimal string alignment (OSA) edit distance.
```
// instantiated class version
var ed = new DamerauOSA();
var dist = ed.Distance("flintstone", "hanson");
// you can also specify the max distance you care about, which can result in significant speed improvement
var dist = ed.Distance("flintstone", "hanson", 2);

// static class version
var dist = DamerauOSA.Distance("flintstone", "hanson");
dist = DamerauOSA.Distance("flintstone", "hanson", 2);
```
