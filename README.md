# SoftWx.Match
##### C# library to aid fuzzy matching

3/14/20018 - If you're getting this, check back in a couple days. I'll soon be pushing out a new version that is in the .net standard library format that also produces a nuget package, adds a maxDistance version of the Levenshtein function, and adds an instantiated class wrapping the edit distance functions that is extremely memory efficient. For non-trivial strings, this new version will be faster and require less memory than any of the other Levenshtein packages I've seen.
